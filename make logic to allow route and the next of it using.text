make logic to allow route and the next of it using regx  ---- hald of that completed

1-convert route set from user to regx that must begin in start and after that complete or without complete.

e.g. user route : /home/action
converts to : /^\/home\/action[\W]*$/

//which means it must follows that pattern

2-check the url which is requested is follow any pattern of api //solve of problem running middleware in invalid request uri
